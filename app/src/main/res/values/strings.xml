    <string name="fruit_content">Lychee[3] (US: /ˈliːtʃiː/ LEE-chee, UK: /ˈlaɪtʃiː/ LIE-chee; Litchi chinensis; Chinese: 荔枝; pinyin: lìzhī; Jyutping: lai6 zi1; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: nāi-chi) is a monotypic taxon and the sole member in the genus Litchi in the soapberry family, Sapindaceae. It is a tropical tree native to South China, Malaysia, and northern Vietnam.[4][5] The tree has been introduced throughout Southeast Asia and South Asia.[5] Cultivation in China is documented from the 11th century.[4] China is the main producer of lychees, followed by Vietnam, India, other countries in Southeast Asia, other countries in the South Asia, Madagascar, and South Africa. A tall evergreen tree, it bears small fleshy sweet fruits. The outside of the fruit is a pink-red, rough-textured soft shell. Lychee seeds contain methylene cyclopropyl glycine which has caused hypoglycemia associated with outbreaks of encephalopathy in undernourished Indian and Vietnamese children who consumed lychee fruit.[6][7]</string>
